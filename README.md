# Project Name

## Description

This project is designed to provide a simple set of commands to set up and run the project. It assumes the existence of a `.env.default` file and provides instructions for copying it to create a `.env` file. Additionally, it includes commands for installing project dependencies using Yarn and starting the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.default` file to create a new `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.default .env
   ```

   This command copies the default environment configuration file to a new file named `.env`. The `.env` file is often used to store environment-specific configurations, such as API keys or database connection strings.

2. Install project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This command fetches and installs the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. Yarn is a package manager that is commonly used in JavaScript/Node.js projects.

3. Start the project:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This command initiates the project, typically launching a development server or executing the main application. The specific behavior may vary based on the project configuration.

## Additional Information

- Make sure to review and update the `.env` file with any necessary environment-specific configurations.
- Check the project documentation for more detailed information on configuration options, scripts, and other project-related details.
